# Question-1
please write a function that returns fibonacci sequence based on the following arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and conditions. The fibonacci function should be implemented using Dynamic Programming.

Fibonacci Sequence Calculation -

Development Environment:
- Language: C
- Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Operating System: [Your Operating System]

Source Code Compilation:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code file (fibonacci.c).

3. Compile the source code using the GCC compiler with the following command:
gcc fibonacci.c -o fibonacci.exe


This command compiles the source code file (fibonacci.c) and generates an executable named "fibonacci.exe".

Running the Program:

1. After successful compilation, run the program by executing the following command:
fibonacci.exe



This command executes the compiled program and initiates the Fibonacci sequence calculation.

2. The program will display the calculated values for each operation, including "add," "mul," "sub," and "fibo."

Example Output:
add : 16
mul : 20
sub : -4
fibo : 2


Each line represents the calculated value for a specific operation.

3. The program execution completes, and the output is displayed.

Additional Notes:

- The provided code does not directly calculate the Fibonacci sequence. Instead, it performs arithmetic operations and conditions using the given structure and operations.

- The Fibonacci sequence calculation itself is not implemented in this code. If you want to calculate the Fibonacci sequence, you would need to modify the code accordingly.
